# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to classify tweets into three categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**, based on their content. This type of sentiment analysis has real-world applications in brand monitoring, public opinion analysis, and social media trend detection.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Scraped and preprocessed a dataset of tweets.
- Performed tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization using **TF-IDF**.
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning classifiers including **Naive Bayes**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- Visualized results using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.
- Classified unseen tweets and displayed sentiment predictions.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Understand and apply text preprocessing techniques.
- Build a sentiment classification model for short-form content (tweets).
- Compare the performance of different supervised learning algorithms.
- Visualize results for better interpretation.
